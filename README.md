## W11-bALF - Windows 11 but _a little_ faster

Two modified scripts just for personal use:
- **DisableSomeServices.bat** - Change some rarely used services to manual and disable services that aren't used for nothing anymore.
- **DisableSomeTelemetry.bat** - Disable telemetry in a safe way, so everything in windows 11 keeps working normally.
